NAME
       MinCut - tool to cut the graph
SYNOPSIS
       ./bin/MinCut [-g file] [<tools> file <job name>] [-h]
DESCRIPTION
       MinCut is a tool to analysis graph, and especially
       for photosynthesis system.
OPTIONS
       -g file [s flow], --generator
           Generating a matrix name <file name>.data, which
           has s flow=[s flow], by default s flow is 2.5.

  tools
       -f file, --FordFulkerson
           Use the Ford Fulkerson algorithms to solve the min
           -cut problem. This function would produce 2 file,
           file.log and file.out.

       -b file, --BruteForce
           Use the brute force ethod to check the s-t cut of
           the graph. Because the minimum cut is the NPC
           problem, this method can't check the large system
           It's use to check the smaller system(maybe < 10).

       -d file, --DFS
           Use the Depth-first Search to build the DFS forest.

       -t file, --BinaryTree
           Use Ford Fulkerson algorithms to build the Tree.

       --plot-network
           Plot network diagram directily by using the program graphviz(dot)
           
  help
       -h, --help
           Print a help message and exit
